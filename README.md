# OilAndGas_Project
Designed and implemented a SQL Server database from scratch, a data warehouse in dimensional modeling, and SSIS packages to feed the data warehouse dimensions and to extract the new data to the fact table. Deployed the SSIS packages to the SSISDB Catalog. Scheduled a job using SQL Server Agent service to run the batch pipeline daily.
